       From the moment you set foot in here, you realized this must a shelter. 
       Somehow you just feel safe staying in this place.
       From the windows you see a trail leading into the woods.

       You see a hollowed out human body lying on the ground.
       Your instinct tells you something went terribly wrong.
       Sitting beside that is a wounded soldier, who looks like
       he can die at any moment.

       At first you wanted to say hi but looking again you knew 
       something is off with this dude, that his snake-like brown-grey 
       intestines dragged in the dirt as he staggered toward you using 
       only its ears and nose for guidance.

       You are staring into a huge space of emptiness,
